## Installation

  1. Install homebridge: `npm install -g homebridge`
  2. Install this plugin: `npm install -g homebridge-konnected`
  3. Update your configuration file

## Configuration

### Starter Settings for config.json:
The following two fields are required for the Konnected plugin to start.
```json
{
  "name": "Konnected",
  "platform": "konnected"
}
```

### What to Expect:

After loading this plugin **for the first time**, it will attempt to discover the Konnected panel(s) on the same local network as Homebridge. Once discovered, the plugin will try to:
1. adjust the Homebridge config.json file with details of the discovered panel(s), assigning a name, a unique identifier, the IP address, and port for each panel;
2. provision each panel, the result is a fresh panel with unassigned zones in Homebridge.

Once the plugin has completed the above two steps, you should also notice that a new security tile 'Konnected Alarm' is exposed in your HomeKit app's default room. You can rename this to whatever you want.

For the security system tile to have any meaningful function you must add zones with sensors on your panel(s) to your config.json file in Homebridge.

### Plugin and Zone Settings Example for config.json:
The best way to generate an error-free config.json is by installing and using the [Config UI X Plugin](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x#readme) for Homebridge. The Konnected Homebridge plugin binds to the Config UI X configuration GUI which makes setting up the zones a trivial process.

For those without Config UI X, or are running this on HOOBS < 4.0, please see the following example configuration for this plugin:

### Configuration Field Explanations:

* **"platform"**: *(required)* Must always be "konnected" 
* **"name"**: *(required)* Can be anything, it is the name that will appear in your Homebridge log.
* **"advanced"**: An object of optional advanced plugin settings:
  * **"listenerIP"**: *(optional)* Use this field to force the network IPv4 address that this Homebridge plugin will listen from for zone state changes. This is useful if the system hosting Homebridge/HOOBS has multiple active network adapters (The system is connected both via wifi and ethernet but certain traffic is routed to one or the other, etc.)*
  * **"listenerPort"**: *(optional)* Use this field to force the network port that this plugin will listen for zone state changes on (between 1000 and 65535).
  * **"discoveryTimeout"**: *(optional)* A length of time in seconds (between 1 and 300) to allow this plugin to discover all of Konnected panels on the network.
  * **"entryDelaySettings"**: *(optional)* An object of settings related to the period of delay after someone enters (violates) the security system. If there is a beeper present, by default it will have a constant sound, but if you use the example values, it will produce a long tone once every second so you know how much time you have to disarm the security system:
    * **"delay"**: *(optional)* The time it takes before the security system is triggered and the siren zone is triggered (in seconds).
    * **"pulseDuration"**: *(optional)* Beeper setting for how long the its pulse is maintained in the on state for when the system is violated (in milliseconds, e.g. 975).
    * **"pulsePause"**: *(conditional - required if pulseRepeat exists)* Beeper setting for how long the it pauses between pulses (in milliseconds, e.g. 25).
    * **"pulseRepeat"**: *(conditional - required if pulsePause exists)* Beeper setting for how many times it repeats the pulse sequence (infinite = -1, e.g., -1)
  * **"exitDelaySettings"**: *(optional)* An object of settings for the delay of time used before the security system has been completely armed. By default, if there is a beeper present, the Away mode will have an audible beeper countdown over the course of the entire delay time:
    * **"delay"**: *(optional)* The time it takes before the security system is armed, if nothing is set the default is 30 seconds (in seconds).
    * **"audibleBeeperModes"**: *(optional)* Choose which arming modes will have an audible beeper countdown. Any one of the following:
        * "0" for home/stay mode
        * "1" for away mode
        * "2" for night mode
* **"panels"**: A panel must exist to associate different sensors and actuators with zones. This section is an array of objects that represent the various panel details and features as well as zones:
  * **"name"** *(required)* The name of the specific panel.
  * **"UUID"** *(required/auto-generated/readonly)* The unique identifier for the panel.
  * **"ipAddress"** *(required/auto-generated/changeable)* The active IP address of the panel.
  * **"port"** *(required/auto-generated/changeable)* The active network port of the panel.
  * **"blink"** *(optional)* Blink panel LED when zones change/report their state. (Values: true or false).
  * **"zones"**: *(optional)* An array of objects that represent assigned zones on the panel:
    * **"enabled"**: Conveniently lets you to create zone settings in the config.json file but not have them actually be provisioned in the panel nor create an accessory in HomeKit. (Values: true or false).
    * **"zoneNumber"**: (quoted number "#") Depending on the panel, the following assignments are allowed:
      * V1/V2 Panel: "1" through "6", "out" or "alarm".

      * "contact"
      * "motion"
      * "glass" 
      * "temperature"
      * "temphumid" or "temperature_humidity" (will expose two sensors in HomeKit)

## Particulars

### Security System Modes:

There are four main states for most traditional alarm systems (thanks to @ShaunBennett for nicely writing out their suggested purpose):
1. **Home/Stay:** You might want to freely roam your house while the perimeter is secure, yet be alerted when smoke/water/CO sensors detect problems or front/side doors/gates are opened unexpectedly.
2. **Night:** You sleep upstairs and want to only have motion sensors downstairs trigger the security system at night.
3. **Away:** Set as many binary sensors as you like to detect changes and trigger the security system.
4. **Disarmed:** Nothing will trigger the security system at all.

That being said, HomeKit has the ability to programmatically hide both the Home/Stay mode and the Night mode if you don't use them. What's even better – this plugin will dynamically choose whether or not these security system modes are needed based on what ***triggerable modes*** are selected for sensors or switches.

If you don't want a Night mode for the security system, remove the Night mode from the triggerable mode setting for all sensors and switches; the same goes for the Home/Stay mode as well.

### Triggering Beeper, Siren, and Strobe Actuators:

The Konnected Homebridge plugin affords some automatic conveniences when actuating Beepers, Sirens and Strobe zones. This means that if you wish to have any of these types of devices working in your security system, they must be specifically set in the zone to be a "beeper", "siren", or "strobe".

Homebridge will automatically find the beepers, sirens and strobe switches, no matter what panel they are on, and actuate them based on their configuration.

**For Example:**

When the security system is in a state of 'entry delay', beeper zones may be triggered to warn a user that the system is armed and needs to be disarmed.
When the security system has passed the time of 'entry delay' and becomes triggered, the alarm should sound and the siren and strobe light zones will be triggered.

The great thing is that you can have multiple beepers, or sirens and strobe lights all fire off as one – but exist on different panels and zones across your house.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing/Stale Accessories:

Sometimes you may need to reboot Homebridge **once-more** after changes made to the configuration for the zone accessories to show up the first time or to reflect the changes and work properly in HomeKit. This is partially because this Homebridge plugin uses a cache to keep it performant and needs to rebuild it once on launch, and then read from it on second launch to update the accessories in HomeKit.

Also it's always good to restart the HomeKit app after changes made to the Homebridge configuration as HomeKit does some background cleanup to the states and presence of devices in its accessory database.

### Check the Forums:
Before anything, please review the [Konnected Homebridge Forum](https://help.konnected.io/support/discussions/forums/32000043024) to see if there's already a similar issue reported where a solution has been proposed.

### "Did You Try Rebooting It?":

Sometimes fixing a problematic Homebridge/HOOBS/HomeKit accessory is as simple as deleting Homebridge's `cachedAccessories` file.

1. First stop Homebridge/HOOBS.
2. Delete the `cachedAccessories` file which is commonly located in its respective folder:

    * Homebridge:
      * Linux-based/MacOS: `~/.homebridge/accessories/cachedAccessories`
      * Windows: `$HOME\.homebridge\Accessories\cachedAccessories`
    * HOOBS:
      * HOOBSBox/Linux-based/MacOS:
      * v3.x: `~/.hoobs/etc/accessories/cachedAccessories`
      * v4.x: `/var/lib/hoobs/konnectedbridge.accessories/cachedAccessories`
      * <strike>Windows</strike> (HOOBS does not work on Windows)

3. Once the file is deleted, start up Homebridge/HOOBS and allow it to regenerate your accessories and the cache.

**WARNING:** Be careful to not delete the `persist` folder or its contents! Your Homebridge and devices will become unresponsive and you will have to completely re-pair the Homebridge bridge (remove and re-scan the QR-code for Homebridge and set up all of your accessories/devices again).

### Check the Discord Channel:
As a last resort **(only because it's NOT monitored regularly)** try checking the [Homebridge Discord Konnected channel](https://discord.gg/YsujtCysZZ). Sometimes troubleshooting a problem needs further real-time interaction and live chat can help.

As well, the Homebridge Discord server is a great place to get help for general Homebridge configuration questions too.
